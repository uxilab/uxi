# UXI

The name comes from the contraction of UX and UI.

UXI currently only supports React but the team is already thinking about a vue.js support.

## Mission

Bringing components to easily build large web application loved by your end-users.

## Entreprise UX-UI at scale

UXI wants to become the open-source leader into the world of component library for Enterprise.

## Target Audience

If you want to build a MVP for your product, an internal web application, a publicly facing web application or a SaaS product including white labelling, we beleive UXI can help you.

## Unique Selling Point and why shoud I use it?

### Not just 'few components' but a whole strategy

UXI is not just a component library, it comes with a whole set of UX and UI best-practises that your users would benefit from. Even if the current version is not entirely finished, we will take topics such as responsive, accessibility, keyboard shortcuts seriously to always bring a 'don't make think' UX to your user with an impressive look and feel.

### Business Agnostic, so you can focus on Business Value

When creating an application for your users, we beleive developers should be focused on delivering Business values to the user, this means the less time you spend on buiness agnostic part, the more time you have to satisfy your users. UXI aims to remove a large chunk of business agnostic work for you on the UI and UX side, so you can focus back on your users.

### White Labelling

We want to easily have web application tailored by your users by simply picking few colors. Of course, UXI supports 'exit' strategy to always override our default style but the idea is to provide a quick way to brand all components not only like you like but also like your users like.

### Unifying UI, UX and Technology

By providing sketch files for all our components, we also encourage your designers to re-use the same naming for your pages, components, properties. This will create an environment where everyone relies on the same linguo which avoid confusions and distractions. Your designer can create 'pixel-perfect' mockups with the assurance that it will look exactly the same as when it will be coded. We strongly believe the easier the conversion from mockups to code is, the easier it is to move fast and create great experience for your users.

### Entreprise Quality

UXI provides components that are tested and used in production. We also do some usability testing to ensure that our componets are well understood and loved by the end-users. In the future, we will release those recodring publicly so you can be confident that our UI and UX choices are 'validated' not only technically but also UX wise.
