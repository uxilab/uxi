      Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake!It all makes sense!
      In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be?
      He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends,
      like you and me! I should've known way back when...
      You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.
