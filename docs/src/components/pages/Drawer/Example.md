### Do not open a Drawer without providing a way out!


this component `open` prop behaviour comes only in a weird mix of "controlled/uncontrolled" flavoured for now...

Pressing the esc key while the Drawer is open will have for effecrt to close it.

But there's no visual (mouse pointer) built-in way out in a Drawer! 

Drawer's `children` must be an element (cannot be a string)
