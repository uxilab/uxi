Select accepts a `disabled` bool prop.

Defaults to `false`.

Disabled true Will make the compo slightly transparent (.7 opacity), grayscale, and will remove all events handlers.

The cursor will be set as "not-allowed".

The element will not be accessible as part of the "document focus track" when disabled.
